    "Let's find the probability of B. It's clear that you can only say you have survived the cleaning if you're in the list after all the cleaning days. That is, P(B) is probability of staying in the list after the last day. This probability is conditional, i.e. depends on the previous days, because you must survive all the days. Then P(B) = P(bn) = P(b1) x ... x P(bn-1), where b1...bn-1 are probabilities to survive on the days 1...n-1, and x means multiplication.\n",

    "Let's designate the number of friends on the first day as f. Then, the probability to survive on the first day is simply p(b1) = (f-1)/f. The probability to survive on the second day is p(b2) = p(b1) x (f-2)/(f-1)\n",

    "The probability to survive on the third day is p(b3) = p(b2) x (f-3)/(f-2). And the probability to survive on the nth day is p(bn) = p(bn-1) x (f-n+2)/(f-n+1).\n",
